        <h1 class="interactive-h1"> Teen's Social Media Usage: What's Changed Over the Past Decade, and What it Means
        </h1>
        <p> When Northwestern junior Evelyn Ahdieh wakes up every morning to the sound of her generic iPhone alarm, the first thing she does is open TikTok.
            <!--Creates a line break in the story-->
            <br><br> “I hate to admit it, but it’s almost second nature at this point,” Ahdieh sheepishly shared. “It’s just part of the morning routine, like brushing my teeth or washing my face.”
            <br><br> And she’s not alone. According to PEW Research Center survey data from 2024, 93% of teens say they are online almost constantly or several times a day. The same survey also found that 95% of teens have access to a smartphone at home and have for the past three years of survey data, a 22% jump from 2014-2015.

            <p>
                The past decade has seen many changes in the social media landscape: Twitter is now X, Meta owns Instagram and Facebook, and TikTok did not even exist when the initial survey data was collected in 2014. 
            <br><br>The types of social media that teens are using is changing, and so is what they use social media for. Short form content apps like TikTok and Instagram have seen gradual increases in daily usage over the past three years, while YouTube has seen declines in general use. Another 2024 PEW Research Center survey found that the share of people regularly getting their news from TikTok has increased from 3% in 2020 to 17% in 2024, and of the app’s regular users, the number who regularly get their news from the platform has more than doubled since 2020.
            <br><br>“I would say a majority of the headlines I learn about are from opening Instagram or TikTok,” Ahdieh said. “Or if not on social media, I get a New York Times app notification. I’m never turning on the news or browsing news websites, which is funny because my parents constantly have MSNBC playing on the TV at home.”

                There are two sides to the social media news cycle coin. On one hand, news outlets are capturing younger audience’s attention in an accessible way that was unimaginable a decade prior, with only 73% of teens owning smartphones, as compared to 95% in 2024. But with the freedom and overwhelming amount of content that’s out there, there is no better hotbed for the spread of misinformation than on social media.
            <br><br>“I do worry that people my age don’t do their own research and are too quick to believe everything they see on TikTok,” said Ahdieh. “I mean, even I do it sometimes. I’ve been laughed at in the group chat more times than I can count for falling victim to clickbait.”
            <br><br>Social media is not going away, and teens and young adults are only growing more reliant on their technological devices. If 2015 was for Facebook memes and Twitter reposts, then 2025 is for Instagram headlines and TikTok interviews, and the media must strive to adapt to this changing climate of communication while informing young people on the news they need every day.

             METHODOLOGY:
            <br>I got the data I used for this story from the PEW Research Center. They published this data in 2024, and linked to the survey questions and responses they used to report and create the final story. I pulled the data from their website into a PDF format, and then transferred the relevant data for my story into a spreadsheet that I organized and made. While it was different from the methods we have used in class to simply pull data sets from the web, it allowed me to be intentional and selective with what data I wanted to use from the survey and transfer to my spreadsheet. Luckily, the data was pretty simple and did not require much cleaning. I analyzed the changes and trends in survey responses over time, and used this data to guide my reporting and interviewing. I also chose to focus specifically on young people using social media for the news, which I knew from my own experiences and the interview I conducted was most relevant to TikTok and Instagram, so I focused on this data and made sure to include all of it in my spreadsheet. I created two interactives using Flourish for this story, and pulled the relevant data for each and created a new sheet for it that I inputted into Flourish.
